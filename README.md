# HW9.16.20DayPlanner

This is a simple day planner website.

It will first place all the work hours on the left (from an array of work hours).

It will then make a field for an entry and also a button to save the entry.

The code is written to save the entry into local storage so that when the page is reloaded the text is still there.

Additionally, the input fields are color coded with a "past, present, future" color coordination. This is achieved by comparing the current time to the 'id' of each field.
